# Rules â€” Read this

These rules are short and simple. Follow them.

- Keep the repo clean. Put only code and small files here.
- Do NOT change or delete `.gitignore` and configuration files like `.editorconfig`, `next-config.ts`, etc.
- Do NOT put passwords, keys, or secret files into the repo.
- If you add a secret by mistake, inform discord right away in #announcements.
- Make a branch for your work. Example: `dev/aryan` or just `aryan`.
- Do NOT work directly on `main`, `master`, `production`.
- Make a Pull Request (PR) to add your work to main.
- Do NOT merge your own PR into a protected branch without approval.
- Do NOT use `git push --force` on shared branches.
- Do NOT rewrite or erase shared history.
- Do NOT change CI or `.github/workflows` without the team agreeing.
- Big files: ask the team first.
- If something breaks, stop pushing. Tell the team lead and show the last commit hash.

Thank you. Follow these rules to keep the project safe and fair.
